## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

An application to manage tasks.


## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

Application is an android application programmed using the Java language. 

- The main page should have a heading at the top of the page and buttons at the bottom of the page to allow going to the “add tasks” and “all tasks” page.
- Additionally, it contains three different buttons with hardcoded task titles. When a user taps one of the titles, it should go to the Task Detail page, and the title at the top of the page should match the task title that was tapped on the previous page.
- Also, an wrench image allows users to visit the Settings page, and once the user has entered their username, it should display “{username}’s tasks” above the three task buttons.

- On the “Add a Task” page, allow users to type in details about a new task, specifically a title and a body. When users click the “submit” button, show a “submitted!” label on the page.
### Add Task Screenshots

- The all tasks page should just be an image with a back button; it needs no functionality.
### All Tasks Screenshot

- Settings page. It should allow users to enter their username and hit save.


- Task Detail page should have a title at the top of the page, and a Lorem Ipsum description.
